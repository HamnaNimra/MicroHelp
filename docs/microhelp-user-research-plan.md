### Method 3: Prototype Testing (Usability)

**Target:** 10-15 users  
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Format:** In-person or remote (Zoom + screen share)  
**Incentive:** $40 gift card

**Test Flow:**

**Setup:**
- Use Figma prototype or functional MVP
- Give user specific scenarios to complete
- Think-aloud protocol (narrate what they're doing)
- Observe without helping (painful but necessary)

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Post a Request**
"Your car won't start and you need jumper cables. Use the app to get help."

**Observe:**
- Can they find the "+" button?
- Do they understand request vs offer?
- Is 200 char limit clear?
- Do they understand radius settings?
- Do they notice anonymity toggle?

**Questions after:**
- Was anything confusing?
- What would you change?
- Did you feel confident someone would see this?

**Scenario 2: Accept a Request**
"You see a neighbor needs help moving a couch upstairs. You have 10 minutes to spare. Help them."

**Observe:**
- Can they find the post detail?
- Do they notice poster's gender/age/trust score?
- Do they understand what "accept" means?
- Is safety information clear?

**Questions after:**
- Did you feel safe accepting this?
- What information was missing?
- Would you actually do this in real life?

**Scenario 3: Chat & Complete**
"You accepted the request. Coordinate with them and mark it complete when done."

**Observe:**
- Can they find the chat?
- Is it clear how to send a message?
- Can they find "mark complete"?
- Do they understand both people must confirm?

**Questions after:**
- Was chatting intuitive?
- How would you share your exact address?
- What happens if they don't show up?

**General Usability:**
- System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire
- Net Promoter Score: "How likely are you to recommend this to a friend?" (0-10)

### Method 4: Behavioral Observation (Ethnographic)

**Target:** 5-10 participants  
**Duration:** 1 week per participant  
**Format:** Diary study + follow-up interview  
**Incentive:** $50 gift card

**Process:**
1. Recruit participants who live in pilot neighborhood
2. Ask them to document every time they need help over 1 week
3. Provide diary template (Google Form or Notion)
4. Follow-up interview to discuss findings

**Diary Template:**

After each incident, log:
- Date/time
- What did you need help with?
- Who did you ask? (neighbor, friend, service, no one)
- Why did you choose that person/method?
- How long did it take to get help?
- How did you feel about the experience?
- Would you have used an app like MicroHelp? Why/why not?

**Follow-up Interview Questions:**
- Looking back at your week, what surprised you?
- Were there patterns you noticed?
- When would an app have been useful?
- When would you NOT have used an app?

**Goal:** Understand real behavior, not hypothetical. What people say vs what they do often differ.

## Analysis Framework

### Qualitative Analysis (Interviews)

**Process:**
1. Record all interviews (with permission)
2. Transcribe using Otter.ai or Rev
3. Code transcripts using thematic analysis
4. Use Dovetail or Notion for organizing insights

**Themes to Look For:**
- Barriers to asking (fear, awkwardness, don't know neighbors)
- Safety concerns (especially from women)
- Trust factors (what makes someone trustworthy)
- Use cases (most common requests)
- Competitive gaps (what Nextdoor/TaskRabbit don't solve)
- Feature requests
- Deal-breakers (would prevent usage)

**Deliverable:**
- Research report with themes + participant quotes
- Affinity map of insights
- Persona updates based on findings

---

### Quantitative Analysis (Survey)

**Metrics to Calculate:**
- **Problem severity:** % who needed help in last 3 months
- **Current solution gaps:** % who went without help or used expensive alternatives
- **Intent to use:** % who said "definitely yes" or "probably yes"
- **Supply/demand match:** Do people want to help with what others need?
- **Safety needs:** What % need gender visibility, verification, etc.
- **Competitive usage:** How many use Nextdoor? Why/why not?

**Segmentation:**
- By age group (are younger users more interested?)
- By living situation (alone vs with family)
- By gender (do women have different needs?)
- By tenure (new residents vs long-term)

**Statistical Tests:**
- Chi-square for categorical differences (gender, age)
- Correlation between variables (knowing neighbors → willingness to help)

**Deliverable:**
- Survey results deck with key findings
- Visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Statistical significance where relevant

---

### Prototype Testing Analysis

**Metrics:**
- **Task completion rate:** Did they finish the scenario?
- **Time to complete:** How long did each task take?
- **Error rate:** How many mistakes/wrong taps?
- **System Usability Scale score:** Industry standard (68 = average)
- **Net Promoter Score:** Likelihood to recommend

**Qualitative:**
- Points of confusion (where did they get stuck?)
- Missing information (what did they look for that wasn't there?)
- Feature requests
- Emotional reactions (frustration, delight, confusion)

**Deliverable:**
- Usability report with specific UX improvements
- Prioritized list of fixes (critical, high, medium, low)

---

## Success Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision

## Research Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Can't recruit enough participants
**Mitigation:**
- Increase incentive ($40 instead of $30)
- Recruit outside target neighborhood if needed
- Use UserInterviews.com (paid recruitment)
- Post in multiple channels

### Risk 2: Positive response bias
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize "no wrong answers"
- Ask about actual behavior, not hypotheticals
- Include diary study (real behavior)
- Look for contradictions between what people say vs do

### Risk 3: Results show no one wants this
**Mitigation:**
- That's actually valuable! Don't build it.
- Identify pivot opportunities
- Save months of wasted development

### Risk 4: Results are inconclusive
**Mitigation:**
- Do more research (extend timeline)
- Test prototype in real neighborhood (beta)
- Start small pilot and measure actual behavior

---

## Post-Research Actions

### If GREEN LIGHT:
1. Update PRD based on findings
2. Prioritize features based on user needs
3. Adjust safety features based on concerns raised
4. Refine personas
5. Proceed to development

### If YELLOW LIGHT:
1. Identify specific issues
2. Design solutions
3. Test solutions with users
4. Iterate until green light

### If RED LIGHT:
1. Document why it failed
2. Identify pivot opportunities
3. Decide: pivot or kill project
4. Don't waste time building something no one wants
