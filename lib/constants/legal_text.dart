Welcome to MicroHelp. By creating an account or using our app, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using MicroHelp, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.

2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old to use MicroHelp. By creating an account, you confirm that you are 18 or older and that the information you provide is accurate.

3. Your Account

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activity under your account. You agree to provide truthful, accurate information during sign-up and to keep your profile information current.

4. How MicroHelp Works

MicroHelp connects neighbors who need small favors ("Requesters") with those willing to help ("Helpers"). The app facilitates connections through posts, chat, and location-based features.

- Requesters post tasks describing what they need help with.
- Helpers can browse and accept tasks near them.
- The app provides a chat for coordination between Requesters and Helpers.

MicroHelp does not employ, endorse, or guarantee any user. We are a platform for connection only.

5. User Conduct

You agree NOT to:
- Use MicroHelp for any unlawful purpose.
- Harass, threaten, or abuse other users.
- Post false, misleading, or inappropriate content.
- Impersonate another person or misrepresent your identity.
- Attempt to collect personal information from other users without their consent.
- Use the app to solicit money, commercial services, or anything unrelated to community help.
- Circumvent safety features or abuse the trust score system.

6. Safety and Trust

MicroHelp offers optional identity verification and a trust score system. These features are tools to help build community trust but do not guarantee the identity, reliability, or safety of any user.

You are responsible for your own safety. Exercise common sense when meeting someone in person. Meet in public places when possible and let someone know where you are going.

7. Content and Intellectual Property

You retain ownership of content you create (posts, messages, profile information). By posting content, you grant MicroHelp a non-exclusive, worldwide license to display and distribute that content within the app as necessary to operate the service.

MicroHelp may remove content that violates these Terms or is reported by other users.

8. Privacy

Your use of MicroHelp is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review it to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information.

9. Termination

You may delete your account at any time from your profile settings. MicroHelp may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

Upon deletion, your profile and posts without active conversations will be removed. Posts with active conversations will be marked as completed and the other user will be notified.

10. Limitation of Liability

MicroHelp is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the app, interactions with other users, or reliance on information provided through the app.

MicroHelp is not responsible for the actions, behavior, or reliability of any user.

11. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of MicroHelp after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
